UVA ProblemSet 101 - The Blocks Problem

Written and compiled on a 64bit Windows 7 machine on Codeblocks 12.11 with GCC 4.7.2 -std=c++11

UVA runs on GCC 4.5.1 so for having it checked use typedef instead of "using" accordingly
also typedef the iterator types accordingly and replace all the "auto" keywords
